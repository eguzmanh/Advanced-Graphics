create a chess scene that is on top of some platform

objects to create:

Objects:
  - Chess Board
  - Chess pieces:
    - NOTE: choose materials that will make the pieces look good!
    - King
    - Queen
    - Bishop
    - Knight
    - Rook
    - Pawn
  - Rooftop  (possibly as a height map)
  - Table/platform

Skybox:
  - create a skyline
  - or create a field with grass and trees and a pond (simulating water and knocking out the project requirements)



Mae a sybox scene that will show a cloudy envirronment and create heigh mapping techniques that will simulate
a rased grassy area where a lake will be beside it

# THings to implement


- find an object that can be used in the scene as a mirror like object, such as 
Implement water with reflection and fresner effect

  - potentially implement a cup of water that has reflection and fresner effect
    
    create a relflected objet that can have the chrome properties that are necessary for the
    mirror that can show the environmeent mapping

    - if the sybox has a night city skyline from a rooftop. then you can use the cup of water idea
    - 

    us normal mapping on the chess board to simulate a more granular
